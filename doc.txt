Things marked with (?) are proposals, but not 100% sure yet.

There are bugs and plants.

Both contain energy, and the environment itself contains energy, too.

A bug has two move-thingies. Both of them can apply a force to the bug INDEPENDENTLY which makes the bug able to ROTATE, like a tank. They can move fast or slow.
However, moving costs energy, and thus, when moving, the bug gives energy to the environment. (note: the faster, the more energy)
The bug has three (?) light sensors, which can see far, but only IF there is something, not WHAT. Two (?) feeling antennas, which can feel and give information about the thing that lies in front of it (if any), but only when it is near to the bug.
Every bug has a spike, which eats up everything it touches. When a bug eats something with energy, it gets its energy.

Plants take the energy from the environment (with a certain speed which is different for each plant). If a plant has much energy (every plant has its own definition of "much" e.g. has a treshold), it clones itself and shares its energy.
